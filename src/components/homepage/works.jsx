								Developed and deployed web scraping scripts using Python to collect marketing and advertising data from competitors' newsletters, providing valuable insights for the company's marketing strategy. 
								Additionally, I contributed to the development of the users' referral tracking API, integrating it with Shopify to enable a seamless reward granting process. Collaborating closely with the team's 
								UI/UX designer, I created wireframes and provided initial frontend development for their new sports newsletter service, which significantly increased the company's daily readership to over 200,000. 
								During this internship, I gained hands-on experience with technologies such as React, Figma, JavaScript, MongoDB, Express, Material UI, and TypeScript, while building the frontend and backend components 
								of the newsletter service, honing my skills in full-stack web development and API integration.
